Kit provides a number of official libraries that are Integrant wrappers meant to work with Kit. Latest version can be seen [here](https://github.com/kit-clj/kit#latest-versions).

There is a great list of Clojure libraries available on the [Clojure Toolbox](https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/). 

At some point there may be a list of some recommended libraries here, however you should not expect it to be up to date and we recommend doing your own research for which libraries are best suited to your project.
