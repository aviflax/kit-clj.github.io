## Profiles

Profiles are clj-new template arguments. They are helpful when you are starting a new project and know ahead of time what functionality you will need. In such cases, you can use profiles to set up a new Kit project without having to manually add libraries and wire them together.

Unlike [modules](/docs/modules.html), profiles are tied to clj-new, the project generation tool. You can only use them when creating a project.

Running `clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.kit-clj :name yourname/app` will create an application using the default profile template.
However, if you would like to attach further functionality to your template you can append profile hints for the extended functionality.

Default libs included with no profile specified:

- `kit-core`
- `kit-undertow`

Additional profiles:

- `+xtdb` - Adds the `kit-xtdb` lib
- `+hato` - Adds the `kit-hato` lib
- `+metrics` - Adds the `kit-metrics` lib
- `+nrepl` - Adds the `kit-nrepl` lib, removes the `kit-repl` lib. Note that you do not need this profile to use nREPL during development.
- `+quartz` - Adds the `kit-quartz` lib
- `+redis` - Adds the `kit-redis` lib
- `+selmer` - Adds the `kit-selmer` lib
- `+socket-repl` - Adds the `kit-repl` lib
- `+sql` - Adds the `kit-sql` and `kit-postgres` libs
- `+full` - Adds the libs `kit-xtdb`, `kit-hato`, `kit-metrics`, `kit-quartz`, `kit-redis`, `kit-repl`, `kit-selmer`, and `kit-sql`

To add a profile, pass it as an argument after your application name, e.g.:

```
clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.kit-clj :name yourname/app :args '[+selmer]'
```

You can also mix multiple profiles when creating the application, e.g.:

```
clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.kit-clj :name yourname/app :args '[+selmer +xtdb]'
```

### Libraries

- `kit-core` - Basic utility functions used by some other libs
- `kit-xtdb` - Simple binding to connect to a [XTDB](https://xtdb.com/) database node
- `kit-hato` - HTTP client using [hato](https://github.com/gnarroway/hato)
- `kit-metrics` - Configurable metrics using [iapetos](https://github.com/clj-commons/iapetos)
- `kit-nrepl` - [nREPL](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl) component. Note that you do not need this library to use nREPL during development.
- `kit-quartz` - Scheduler using [cronut](https://github.com/troy-west/cronut) as an integrant binding for [quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/). Exposes the `cronut` API, simply some extensions for `aero` and utilities
- `kit-redis` - Extension of [core.cache](https://github.com/clojure/core.cache) for Redis via [carmine](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine)
- `kit-repl` - Socket REPL integrant binding
- `kit-selmer` - Templating configuration with [selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer)
- `kit-sql` - Generic SQL integrant binding. Uses [conman](https://github.com/luminus-framework/conman), [next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc), [hugsql](https://www.hugsql.org/), and [migratus](https://github.com/yogthos/migratus) directly, or implicitly. By default, imports `kit-postgres` lib which supports Postgresql
- `kit-postgres` - Lib with data bindings and utilities for working with Postgres
- `kit-undertow` - Server binding via [luminus-undertow](https://github.com/luminus-framework/luminus-undertow)
